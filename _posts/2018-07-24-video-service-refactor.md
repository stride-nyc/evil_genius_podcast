- Introducingâ€¦ a new problem! We talk about how Emmanuel ran across this problem. [**Martin Fowler's blog post**](https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-external-service.html)
- We talk about the problem itself: What is an external service?
- We dive into the code

## Commits

  - Commenting the heck out of this code.

- [**Note where external services are being used to potentially mock out**](https://github.com/stride-nyc/evil_genius_podcast_exercises/commit/67b206820e5571329e9458e22d8d8a1d29d80789#diff-4c208c099901f939b08c104d82f72e60)
  - What makes this stuff an "external service" ?

  - Why minitest over test unit?

- [**Remove unnecessary comments. Stub out method that loads up video list**](https://github.com/stride-nyc/evil_genius_podcast_exercises/commit/5a1e53792e0ad95b14350e24a043d1d36696349b#diff-4c208c099901f939b08c104d82f72e60)
  - Why is `@video_list` an ivar?

- [**Extract external service dependencies into method calls, get first real test**](https://github.com/stride-nyc/evil_genius_podcast_exercises/commit/c2fe51c5dffa0efa5d2cb84a66ec555473146692#diff-4c208c099901f939b08c104d82f72e60)

  - Introduction of new object! How did you decide to name this VideoRepo and make it responsible for parsing the json?
